// basic Collatz explaination:
// If it's even, divide by two, if it's odd, multiply by three and add one.
// Repeat step 2 indefinitely.
// The conjecture states that you will always reach the number one eventually.
// For example, say you start with 5 your sequence would go 5-16-8-4-2-1.


// if n != 0 {
// while num = odd
// (N /=2)
// while num  = even {
// n = (n * 3) + 1}
//
//
// keep this repeating until n = 0

// Requirements:

// count steps until you get to one
